# Yatzee Game - Java/Android App

Yatzee is the second project I completed during CodeClanâ€™s 16-week intensive [course](https://codeclan.com/courses/16-week-course/). It was my first time building an android app, which after having only a three day high-level introduction to android proved to be an interesting challenge.

## Goal

The aim for this project was to practice what we had learned during our Java and Android lessons.

We were given four briefs to choose from, each with supplied MVPs and possible extensions. Inspired by some of the functionality required for one of the project briefs, which was to build a fruit machine, I decided to set my own project brief to write the dice game Yatzee. 

## Yatzee

You want to be able to play Yatzee with your friend on your phone without having adverts playing between each round. You have decided to make your own pass and play, two-player app.

Each player, as part of their turn, must be able to roll a set of five dice at random. The player should be able to roll the dice up to three times, each time being able to hold any of the dice before re-rolling. The player must be able to choose which score category they want to play for each turn, from the 13 categories available in a game of Yatzee. The game must finish after all score categories have been played, i.e. a total of 13 rounds each. A running total must be taken for each player, and a message shown at the end of the game displaying who has won. A message should pop up if the player rolls a Yatzee (5 of-a-kind). 

## Achievments

I successfully managed to meet all of my objectives. I spent a lot of time testing my app with friends on the course to make sure the UX was as intuitive and smooth as possible. I am very pleased with the functionality I have included as well as the appearance and layout of the game.

## To-do

My main activity page could benefit from more refactoring including transferring game logic to my Java models so that the activity page includes only front end code only.
